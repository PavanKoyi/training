Understanding The problem: We have to create the database by observing the ER diagram given.

Inferred Requirements:
                      Table names, Column names in the tables and data types of the columns.

Confirmation: So we have to design a database for University data by creating tables using SQL.

System perspective : 
EVENTS:
1.Create Tables:
         Jobs to be done:
                         Create the tables by using CREATE command
                         Creating the constraints.
                         Identify the PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEYs in the tables
2.Insert data into tables:
                         Insert the data into tables by using INSERT command.
